Issues
======

This was part of main README, but has been somewhat underused.


Logging
=======

When I find an *okay* project, I will open an issue, track, and plan how I can make a video of it. The issue would not be a replacement of YouTube video description box, although I will use it especially for the invalid characters ``<>`` or any codes.

But I employ the similar fashion to log things would be in the description box, such as versions, dates, notes, errors, authors, licenses, etc.


Labeling
========

``type-*``:
  Like some categories of my playlist, they are:

  * ``type-Terminal``
  * ``type-Web``
  * ``type-X-Window``

``os-*``
  The operating systems.

``lang-*``
  The programming language is written in.

``with-*``
  Important required libraries. For instances, ``with-ncurses``, ``with-QT``, ``with-GTK+``, or ``with-SDL``, they could tell you a lot about the project.

``status-*``
  The result of the issue. It could be

  ``status-waiting``:
    Could be some bugs need to be fixed before I could actually make a video, pull requests need to be merged, or whatever reason I need to wait for something to happen.

  ``status-recorded``:
    A video is made and there shall be a link to the video.

  ``status-blogged``:
    A blog post is written for the issue.

  ``status-binned``:
    Nothing is done future, I probably don't thing it's good idea to make a video or write a post. This could happen a lot, but it doesn't necessarily mean the projects are bad.
