This repository is for my YouTube_ channel, it has everything I want to put into my YouTube_ About_ page, which unfortunately has characters limit and can't really have good formatting. This is not only serving as ``README``, also for logs and communications as alternative comment place.

I'm a command-line (CLI) lover, so expecting most of videos are recordings of terminal window, but I do more than that.

If you know any good programs or have ideas for the channel, not limited to CLI, please feel free to send me any information or links using `feedback`_.

About my YouTube videos
=======================

What to expect
--------------

Mostly short, but not tutorials, almost all without audio tracks, no horrible music, no terribly unnecessary transitioning texts. Go straight to the points of what I want to show you about a program.

There will be description about my thoughts, possibly some short notes about controls or command-line options. My video includes the description, video and description together are the whole video, so be sure to read the description.

In the end of description, links and information about version, programming languages and major dependencies or libraries, the author(s), and the license.


Why do I make videos
--------------------

There were times that I went to a project's web page and couldn't figure out what a program would look like, does it even have UI? If I was lucky, I would at least get a screenshot.

So, quick videos to let you see what you might get are the whole idea.


How long and how many?
----------------------

Many are less than one minute, and I would probably upload two a day or even less. But don't count on that, if there is a reason to have ten, then I will upload that many.


More than videos?
-----------------

`My blog`_ is sort of text version of my YouTube channel, I will blog about programs there, but I'd not blog and make video for same subject, unless it's really necessary.

.. _My blog: http://blog.yjl.im

If it's better to introduce using video, then YouTube is. If it's better using text, then my blog. You could `subscribe to the blog`__ for updates.

Why ``READYT``
--------------

Because you need to read the description box of my videos. My YouTube video = *video* + *description*.

``READYT`` was former name of my channel, now it's considered as a codename since February, 2016.
